My name is Lakshmi Anusha. I am a 29-year-old woman. I did an MA in English and a Bachelor's in Microbiology from Andhra University. I am currently working as an HR Executive at a company named Timing Technologies, Hyderabad - India. My long term goal is to become an HR Manager at leading tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, etc.

I am earning a bare minimal amount of 208 USD for the whole month, which is just sufficient to pay the rent, for groceries and other utilities. I want to increase my salary cap by getting placed in any of the companies mentioned above.

I got to know from some of my colleagues that Coursera supports enthusiastic people like me, who want to pursue education in their field of interest that can help them achieve success both in terms of knowledge growth and economic growth, by providing financial aid. I wanted to utilize this feature as I am financially weak at this point. I will surely contribute to the Coursera community by reviewing my peers' works on time and actively participating in forum conversations.

However, my current skill set is limited and I seriously want to work on improving this. I recently found the specialization "Excel Skills for Business" on Coursera that can help me achieve my goals. It contains the following four courses.

1) Excel Skills for Business: Essentials
2) Excel Skills for Business: Intermediate I
3) Excel Skills for Business: Intermediate II
4) Excel Skills for Business: Advanced

I applied for financial aid for the first two courses in the specialization "Human Resource Management: HR for People Managers" ("Preparing to Manage Human Resources", "Recruiting, Hiring, and Onboarding Employees") and successfully completed them within the timelines specified. I am currently waiting for approval of financial aid for the 3rd course ("Managing Employee Performance") in it. Likewise, during this pandemic season break, I would like to complete the whole of "Excel Skills for Business" specialization also.









I am earning a bare minimal amount of 208 USD for the whole month which is just sufficient to pay the rent, for groceries and other utilities. My current employer does not have a reimbursement policy for MOOC.

I would like to increase my salary cap by getting placed in any of the companies mentioned above. Once it is increased by a significant amount I will contribute to the Coursera organization.
